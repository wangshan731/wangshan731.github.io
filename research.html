     <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Problem definition: Multistage service is common in healthcare. One widely adopted approach to manage patient visits in multistage service is to provide patients with visit itineraries that specify personalized appointment time for each patient at each service stage. We study how to design such visit itineraries. Methodology/results: We develop the first optimization modeling framework to provide each patient with a personalized visit itinerary in a tandem (healthcare) service system. Due to interdependencies among stages, our model loses those elegant properties (e.g., L-convexity and submodularity) often utilized to solve the classic single-stage models. To address these challenges, we develop two original reformulations. One is directly amenable to off-the-shelf optimization software, and the other is a concave minimization problem over a polyhedron shown to have neat structural properties, based on which we develop efficient solution algorithms. In addition to these exact solution approaches, we propose an approximation approach with a provable optimality bound and numerically validated performance to serve as an easy-to-implement heuristic. A case study populated by data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute shows that our approach makes a remarkable 28% cost reduction over practice on average. Managerial implications: Common approaches used in practice are based on simple adjustments to schedules generated by single-stage models, often assuming deterministic service times. Whereas such approaches are intuitive and take advantage of existing knowledge of single-stage models, they can lead to significant loss of operational efficiency in managing multistage services. A well-designed patient visit itinerary that carefully addresses the interdependencies among stages can significantly improve patient experience and provider utilization. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Electronic visits, or “E-visits” for short, have emerged as a promising channel for accessing healthcare and can significantly impact daily operations in healthcare facilities. However, there is a lack of research on how to efficiently manage appointments for outpatient care providers when faced with E-visits that exhibit different waiting cost patterns. Our study investigates how providers can use appointment scheduling as a “passive” control when patients have full access to the E-visit channel, to better utilise resources and reduce patient waiting. Specifically, we demonstrate that multimodularity still applies to the model with E-visits, despite their waiting costs being typically nonlinear. Furthermore, we analyse how providers can “actively” control the arrival of E-visits by scheduling their time windows. By examining the structures of the optimal joint schedule of appointments and E-visit time windows, and reformulating the problem into a two-stage program, we have designed an Accelerated Cut Generation Algorithm, which is shown to be efficient in our numerical study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the optimal scheduling of both appointments and E-visit time windows. By implementing proper scheduling, the negative impact of E-visits can be mitigated, their benefits to the provider can be enhanced, and overall operational efficiency can be improved. </p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Outpatient care providers usually allow patients to access service via scheduling appointments or direct walk-in. Patients choose strategically between these two access channels (and otherwise balking) based on the trade-off of appointment delay and in-clinic waiting. How to manage outpatient care with such dual access channels, taking into account patient strategic choice behavior, is a challenge faced by providers. We study three operational levers to address this management challenge: service capacity allocation between these two channels, appointment delay information revelation via the choice and design of online scheduling systems, and a walk-in triage system that restricts the use of walk-in hours only for acute care. By studying a stylized queueing model, we find that neither a real-time online scheduling system (which offers instant access to appointment delay information at time of booking) nor an asynchronous online system (which does not directly provide delay information) can be universally more efficient. Although real-time systems appear more popular in practice, asynchronous systems sometimes can result in higher operational efficiency. Under the provider’s optimal capacity allocation, which scheduling system is more efficient hinges on two key factors: the patient demand–provider capacity relationship and patient willingness to wait. For the walk-in triage system, we find that it may or may not be beneficial to adopt; the provider’s own cost trade-off between lost demand and overtime work is the key determinant. Our research highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all model for outpatient care management, and the best use of operational levers critically depends on the practice environment. </p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Problem definition: Many outpatient care providers offer virtual service that patients can access via televisits. Televisits allow patients to wait to be seen in the location of their choice, protected from exposure to ill patients and without going through the trouble of physical travel. There is evidence, however, that televisits are more likely to lead to a supplementary in-person visit, consuming additional resources that could have been saved if the patient's initial visit was in-person. Given this trade-off, we study whether an outpatient care provider should adopt virtual service and, if so, how best to manage a practice that simultaneously offers both virtual (or URL) and in-person (real-life, or RL) services. Methodology/results: We develop a stylized queueing-game model, which incorporates patient strategic choice between the two service channels. We study how a revenue-driven provider should allocate capacity between these two channels and how to incentivize patients for in-person visits. We find that the size of the system, measured by the total available service capacity relative to total patient demand, plays a determining role here. Small and large systems are better off focusing on one channel only and have no need to use in-person incentives, whereas medium-sized systems can benefit from offering both channels and in-person incentives. We also find that overall patient access to care may be hurt with the use of in-person incentives, unless the payment gap between the two channels is significantly large. Managerial implications: Despite the growing adoption of telemedicine, offering virtual service may not be the best choice for all providers. Capacity coordination between the virtual and in-person service channels has to be carefully balanced. Furthermore, in-person incentives need to be used with caution, otherwise patient access to care may be impaired. Proper financial incentives set up by the payer may prevent such a negative outcome.</p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Inventory management for a new product is challenging due to the lack of historical data, and sales data cannot fully capture the actual demand as excess demand is usually unobservable. Meanwhile, demand-related features are available in the era of big data. To minimize the long-term average overage and underage costs, we study how to determine the order-up-to level in a periodic-review inventory system with feature information and limited historical sales data. We allow the mean demand to be any function of the features. To solve the problem, we develop a neural network-based non-parametric online learning method, NeuroVendor. We prove through regret analysis that the cost of NeuroVendor converges at a rate of O(log T /T ) and O(1/√T ) for perishable and nonperishable inventory respectively, to the clairvoyant optimal cost with an approximation error. Additionally, we show that the approximation error is bounded and diminishes when the neural network size increases. We also note that the smaller the network, the faster the algorithm converges, but the larger the approximation error, indicating a bias-variance trade-off. In numerical experiments, NeuroVendor exhibits faster convergence rates and smaller regrets compared to existing methods. The advantage is more significant with more complex demand functions.</p></div><br>
